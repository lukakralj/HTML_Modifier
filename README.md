# HTML_Modifier for static websites (no PHP)
Modify header of all html documents in your project.

I was working on a personal website and I wanted all pages to have consistent headers (top of the page). However, this was hard to maintain withouth using a pre-defined templates (plus there could be some copyright issues etc) or without using PHP.
So I decided to build this mini program which can edit the files for you, so you don't need to copy and paste your code in every single file - it's easy with three files but with 8 files I already got tired of it :D

How to use it:
1) Specify what you want the program to do in Configuration.txt file.
2) Run the program by simply executing Main.py from the command line (assuming you have python installed on your machine)

NB! Be careful when running the program because it won't allow you to revert the changes. Well at least not yet - it's on a TODO list!
